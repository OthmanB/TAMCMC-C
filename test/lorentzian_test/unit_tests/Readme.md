# Why this

Unit test designed to check if any modification made within the main program (eg. parallelisation)
affects the root functions building the model profiles.
These unit tests will be about testing the build_lorentzian.cpp functions called build_l_mode_[something]
and also the models.cpp functions 
They also give you an idea of the computation time, relative to the reference code

Reference function which are known to be fine are in the ref_code directory of this directory
