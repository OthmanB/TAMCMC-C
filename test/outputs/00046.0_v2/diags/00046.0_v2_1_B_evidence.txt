# This is an output file for the evidence. Evidence is calculated after a quadratic interpolation of L_beta. 
# This file contains values for the L_beta[0:Nchains-1], the evidence calculated at each time the buffer was written 
# col(1): Number of samples used to compute the evidence 
# col(2:2+Nchains): averaged probability <P(D|M,I)> over the samples of each chain 
# col(2+Nchains+1): Evidence P(M|D, I) computed by (1) interpolation and (2) averaging
