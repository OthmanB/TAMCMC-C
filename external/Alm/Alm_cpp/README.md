# integrate Alm~F(theta, phi).|Ylm|^2
Small program for integrating Glm(theta, phi), term that can be used to define activity effect on mode splittings. It uses modified functions taken from https://github.com/CD3/libIntegrate to perform integration in C++ using Gaussian Legendre Quadrature

This code can calculate Alm=Integral(Ylm^2*Filter). With Filter ~ Gate function, the solution are as defined in Gizon 2002, AN, 323, 251â€“253
But can be used to have more flexible activity zone hypothesis than that paper (Filter : Gauss, Gate or Triangle).

The code comes with a suite of tests and visualisation tools in python in ../python_rendering.

# How to use
Use cmake to compile into a build directory:

       mkdir build
       
       cd build
       
       cmake ..
       
       make

This will generate two executables in the ../bin directory.
The Alm executable computes the integral with parameters as per defined into the main() of main.cpp 
The Filter_Alm returns a file with the shape of the filter, for the user-defined parameters (as defined by the get_filter.cpp program). 
This is more a test program to evaluate if the filtering is properly made (see python routines in ../python_rendering).
