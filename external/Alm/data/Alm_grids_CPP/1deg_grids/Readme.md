# What is here?
This is coarse basic grids for l=1,2,3.
The grid were created with the 'GridMaker' executable
The resolution is of 1 degrees. Its interpolation leads to errors smaller than 6e-3 (0.6%) and should fit all purposes in Gate and Triangle case.
NOTE: PLEASE DO NOT USE GRIDS IN GAUSS MODE: FOR AN UNKNOWN REASON, SOME PART OF THE GRID HAS INACURACY>>10%. Because Triangle is in fact better 
than triangle (because it is bounded function), I recommend the triangle case instead.
