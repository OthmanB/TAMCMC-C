# integrate Glm~F(theta, phi).|Ylm|^2
Small program for integrating Glm(theta, phi), term that can be used to define activity effect on mode splittings. It uses modified functions taken from https://github.com/CD3/libIntegrate to perform integration in C++ using Gaussian Legendre Quadrature

This code can calculate Glm as defined in Gizon 2002, AN, 323, 251â€“253
But can be used to have more flexible activity zone hypothesis than that paper.

# How to use
Use cmake to compile into a build directory:
       'mkdir build'
       'cd build'
       'cmake ..'
       'make'

This will generate an executable with parameters as per defined into the main() of ylm.cpp
Note that this main is just for tests. A proper usage would require to include ylm.cpp into a larger projet,
after commenting the main().


PS: This version has the main() section of activtiy.cpp commented because it is intended to be used as a plug-in for the TAMCMC code.
If you want to run it as a standalone, uncomment main() section of your choice in activity.cpp.
