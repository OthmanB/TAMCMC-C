Progress on 1.3.3-Dev

1. test the io_ms_global part by part. In the case (a) without numax provided, (b) with numax provided, (c) a negative (wrong) value of numax
    PS: Investigate the weird code that is activated when do_Width_Appourchaux = 0 and the seems to be not correct
[DONE]

2. if test 1 is ok, then test the new model in models.cpp  
[DONE]

3. if 1 and 2 are ok, test the whole thing on a full MCMC run in DALMA [Need check]

4. If all ok, then consolidate the version and transfer if to github. Then start v1.3.4 that includes the slice analysis of MS stars [Need check]

5a. Adapt the output name for files by adding the slice number at the end (if more than 1 slice available): DONE. Once 6 is finished, will need to see if there is no forgoten names of files that are overwritten

5b. Implement io_local.cpp. Note that it has been already integrated into the program and in the MakeFile. All work should focus on it. [In Progress]
		- WEIRD THING HAPPENING WITH THE SWITCH AUTO-DEFINITION USING FILE: Values are a getting a bit random. Need serious investigation in config.cpp
		  Potential cullprit could be (1) type conversion (2) overwriting at later stage

6. Need to implement if necessary the new functions (from io_MS_Global, with Appourchaux widths or from io_local) into the getmodel and other tools (bin2txt) etc.. [NOT YET]
